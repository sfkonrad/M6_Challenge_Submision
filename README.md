## **M6_Challenge_Submision**
# **San Francisco Housing Rental Analysis**

### This assignment required us to create a visualization by using the integration between Plotly and the Mapbox API. 
### Our objective was to use data visualization techniques, including aggregation, interactive visualizations, and geospatial analysis, to find properties in the San Francisco market that are viable investment opportunities.

**Proptech**, the application of technology to real-estate markets, is an innovative domain in the fintech industry. We've assumed the roles of analysts at a proptech company that intends to offer an instant, one-click service for people to buy properties and then rent them. The company is deploying a trial of this offering in the San Francisco real-estate market. If the service proves popular, the firm will proceed to expand to other markets.

The main task in this Challenge was to visualize and analyze the real-estate data in your Jupyter notebook. Employing our `.ipynb` notebook to complete the following tasks:

## Calculate and plot the housing units per year:
> Use numerical and visual aggregation to calculate the number of housing units per year, and then visualize the results as a bar chart.

## Calculate and plot the average prices per square foot:
> Use numerical and visual aggregation to calculate the average prices per square foot, and then visualize the results as a bar chart.

## Compare the average prices by neighborhood:
> Use interactive visualizations and widgets to explore the average sale price per square foot by neighborhood.

## Build an interactive neighborhood map.
> Explore the geospatial relationships in the data by using interactive visualizations with Plotly and the Mapbox API. To build your map, use the DataFrame, which includes the neighborhood location data with the average prices.

## Compose our data story.
Based on the visualizations that we created, we considered the following:
> - How the trend in rental income growth compares to the trend in sales prices and whether this same trend holds true for all the neighborhoods across San Francisco.
> - Developing insights to share with our company about the potential one-click, buy-and-rent strategy that they are pursuing. 
> - Whether any neighborhoods exist that would suggest opportunity for immediate investment and why.
